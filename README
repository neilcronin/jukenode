This is a tiny expirimental nugget to build a webapp to control an instance of iTunes
running on a Mac, using Express and Jade, and applescript to control itunes

Usage:

node express.js

Fires up the server. Commands:

http://localhost:4000/playlist/[playlistname]

Display details for all the songs in [playlistname]. There are play links to play that
specific song.

http://localhost:4000/stop

Stops iTunes


(express.js is going to get moved into start.js)

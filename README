This is a tiny expirimental nugget to build a webapp to control an instance of iTunes
running on a Mac.

Usage:

node start.js

Fires up the server. Commands:

http://localhost:8124/start

Plays your current iTunes playlist.

http://localhost:8124/stop

Stops iTunes

http://localhost:8124/list

Attempts to use an applescript to list a playlist name that most likely doesnt' exist on your system since it's hardcoded for now.
